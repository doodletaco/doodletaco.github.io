    <h1>Information Innovators</h1>
    <p>Just as groups are important to progress, notable individuals also have made advancements in information.</p>

    <h2>Claude Shannon</h2>
    <p>A mathemetician, Claude Shannon was an important figure in the beginning of the information age. He worked in cryptography and also proposed the idea of Information Theory. This is the idea that when information is sent, it must be able to survive whatever noise happens on the way. A mix of removing redundancy and adding it is needed to ensure accuracy and efficiency. He is the one who coined the term "bit." (Gertner)</p>

It details calculations similar to the methods a modern computer would."/>

    <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>
    <p>Although Lovelace's work was long before the information age began, her work is still important. She is known as the first computer programmer because of the notes she made in Charles Babbage's plans for a computer. This was known as the Analytical Engine, which later came to inspire Alan Turing's strategy to solve the enigma (Biography.com Editors). She also noted that computing like this may sometime go beyond numbers ("Ada Lovelace"). Her work is important as part of what sparked the invention of computing done by machines.</p>
