    <h1>The Transistor and other Inventions</h1>
    <p>The transistor was a key invention to the information age.</p>

            document.getElementById('image2')
                    .style.display = "block";

    <h2>What is a Transistor?</h2>
    <p>A transistor functions in a similar way to a switch, but without moving parts by using properties of p and n-type semiconductors in order to amplify a signal. This was previously done through vacuum tubes, but those are much larger. A transistor allowed technology to become more accessible and compact.</p>

    <h2>Another Innovation: Optical Communication</h2>
    <p>Optical communication is the use of light in order to transmit information. An early example is the semaphore telegraph, using towers with arms in order to relay information from one station to the next, until it reaches its destination ("Optical Telegraph.")<br>A more recent development is the use of a silicon-based device that uses all-optical communication at >100Gb/s. The goal of this is to continue Moore's Law, and allow even more data to be communicated on a chip (Pool.)</p>
