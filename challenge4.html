    <h1>Interpersonal Innovation</h1>
    <p>Collaboration is a crucial aspect of invention, when multiple people work together with different skills to make something new.</p>

    <button type="button" onclick="show()" id=btnID>Show Image</button>

    <script>
        function show() {

            /* Access image by id and change
            the display property to block*/
            document.getElementById('image')
                    .style.display = "block";

            document.getElementById('btnID')
                    .style.display = "none";
        }
    </script>

    <h2>Why does it help?</h2>
    <p>The purpose for having people together for innovation is relatively intuitive. If people are able to easily meet someone who could help solve a proble, that process becomes quicker. The work culture becomes closer and allows for people to collaborate with all sorts of people.</p>

    <button type="button" onclick="show2()" id=btnID2>Show Image</button>

    <script>
        function show2() {

            /* Access image by id and change
            the display property to block*/
            document.getElementById('image2')
                    .style.display = "block";

            document.getElementById('btnID2')
                    .style.display = "none";
        }
    </script>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>However, there are some downsides to this. Remote work became commonplace due to the pandemic, which changed the culture of even a typical office. Employees could work from their couch, or make a small office of their own. One downside for the open layout for innovation was a pressure to always be productive, working longer hours and burning out. Hybrid work, with intentional collaboration may be the new future (Miller).</p>
