    <h1>Hi! This is my site.</h1>
    <p>I am Doodle, and I am studying Computer Science and Information Science! I also draw digitally and do some other crafts.</p>

    <h2>Some of my links.</h2>

    <h2>What I'm about.</h2>
    <p>
        I hope to use this site as a way for me to share what I am doing and making. I am very passionate about web accessibility, so this site is intentionally basic. I borrowed from <a href="https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this website</a> to make it look nice too.
