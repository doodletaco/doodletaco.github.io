    <h1>Materials for the Information Age</h1>
    <p>In order for there to be a transistor, or a computer, or really any creation, materials are needed to make it real.</p>

            /* Access image by id and change
            the display property to block*/
            document.getElementById('image')
                    .style.display = "block";

    <h2>The Importance of Silicon</h2>
    <p>Silicon is a key component of transistors. As a semiconductor, it is able to have a current, but does not do so as well as a metal. It also conducts electricity better than metals at higher temperatures (Pappas). This ability, along with unique impurities, makes it so that the element can function similar to a switch, where it blocks, or insulates current, but is also capable of amplifying a current. These tiny, incredibly fast switches innovated technology, from simply sending a signal, to radios, to modern computers.</p>

        function show2() {

            /* Access image by id and change
            the display property to block*/
            document.getElementById('image2')
                    .style.display = "block";

            document.getElementById('btnID2')
                    .style.display = "none";
        }
    </script>

    <h2>Another Key Material: Gold</h2>
    <p>Gold is mostly known as a very valuable metal, but is also very important to the manufacturing of computers. It is both ductile and malleable, so there is a lot one can do with it. It can be made into a sheet or wire, and is used for thermal regulation, preventing corrosion, or conducting a current (Fearon). It also has many other practical uses, but its use in computing allows for the hardware to be more durable over time.</p>
